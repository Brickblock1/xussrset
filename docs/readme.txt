xUSSR Railway Set v0.2

The xUSSR Railway Set includes locomotives, DMUs, EMUs and other rolling stock
from the former Russian Empire, Soviet Union and several countries containing
former U.S.S.R. All the vehicles are drawn in realistic extended scale,
exceeding original Transport Tycoon graphics. All technical features such as
power, tractive effort, capacity, production date are based on pecularities and
functionality of real vehicles.
